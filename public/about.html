        <h1>About Lucy</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I am a passionate individual with a mix of interests and aspirations. Academically, I am focused on my studies at South China Normal University, where I am working hard to improve and achieve my goals. Outside of academics, I have various hobbies and interests that keep me busy.</p>
            <p>One of my main professional interests is AI painting and PS, which can beatify my photo when I am a coser. Now I spend a lot of time on using Stable Diffusion to learn how to combine PS with AI.</p>
            <p>In my personal life, I enjoy computer games. Whether it's spending time with friends and family, engaging in sports, or pursuing creative outlets, these activities help me stay balanced and motivated.</p>
            <p>What's more, I am a quadratic fan, usually in my spare time I will watch Japanese animation, I especially like an animation name is Free! It tells the story of how a group of men chase their swimming dreams and finally stand on the world stage and win the championship together with the team, which is very warm and I like it very much. Here are some pictures about Free!</p>

            <p>Hello! My name is Lucy. I am a sophomore studying AI now!!</p>
            <p>Actually I am someone who is often lost, yet always striving. I possess a mix of pride and numerous flaws, but my passion keeps me moving forward, even if I often feel like a failure. My journey hasn't been easy, and my self-esteem has taken hits, especially after not performing well in the college entrance exams. However, I am here, pushing through and working hard.</p>
            <p>I have a complicated relationship with English - it's a subject that frustrates me deeply. Despite putting in a lot of effort, I haven't been able to master it, and sometimes it makes me feel incredibly down. But I am determined to overcome this challenge, no matter how hard it gets.</p>
            <p>On this website, I hope you will find more about me, my interests, and a fun quiz that I've created. Thank you for visiting!</p>
